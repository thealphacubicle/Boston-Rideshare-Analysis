# Boston Rideshare Analysis

## Executive Summary
Welcome to an in-depth analysis of rideshare pricing in Boston! This analysis focuses on understanding how rideshare companies price their rides. Throughout this analysis, I've examined how the two largest rideshare companies—Uber and Lyft—price their rides. Given an in-depth dataset found [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices?select=cab_rides.csv), I've analyzed what features most affect the respective pricing models. Using the various statistical analysis methods listed below, I've concluded that Uber tends to be cheaper than Lyft in the Boston area; moreover, Lyft weights their pricing more heavily on ride-share destinations whereas Uber weights environmental factors in their pricing model.
